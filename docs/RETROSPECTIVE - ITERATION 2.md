# Retrospective: Iteration 2

Group 2 - Git Gud

**_A part of the project that has not been as successful as we would have liked, and how it can be improved in this iteration:_**

In our last iteration, communication breakdowns were evident as team members often failed to update each other on their progress or significant changes that could impact the iteration's delivery. This lack of communication hindered issue resolution and is ultimately what led to our late hand-in.

A key contributing factor was the absence of a designated coordinator, familiar with all aspects of the project and the deliverables, tasked with monitoring the progress of individual team members. Without this oversight, tasks often progressed unchecked, leading to issues remaining undiscovered until they became urgent, too close to the deadline for effective resolution.

To rectify this in the upcoming iteration, we propose assigning a team member as a task coordinator to oversee progress and facilitate communication. This individual will serve as a central point of contact for raising concerns and challenges, ensuring better transparency and issue resolution. Implementing regular check-ins and status updates will further enhance communication and alignment across the team.

By adopting these changes, we aim to create a more collaborative and communicative environment, boosting productivity and success in the next iteration.

**_Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective):_**

- Designating a Task Coordinator: A specific team member the role of Task Coordinator. This individual will be responsible for regularly checking in with team members to ensure they are on track with their tasks, identifying any potential roadblocks or challenges, and facilitating communication among team members.

- Implementing Regular Stand-up Meetings: Bi-weekly stand-up meetings will be implemented where team members can quickly share updates on their progress, any obstacles they're facing, and their plans for their current task. This will encourage transparency and accountability within the team.

Success evaluation:
- Frequency of Communication: Frequency of communication among team members can be tracked. An increase in communication frequency suggests improved collaboration and transparency.

- Issue Resolution Time: The average time taken to identify and resolve issues or obstacles encountered during Iteration 3 can be measured. A decrease in issue resolution time would indicatee improved responsiveness and problem-solving skills within the team.
