## TeachReach
A platform to connect students easily with tutors!

## Purpose

TeachReach is an Android app that connects students seeking academic help with qualified tutors from post-secondary institutions. Its primary purpose is facilitating tutoring sessions, allowing students to find and book sessions with tutors who have excelled in their respective courses. Our platform supports scheduling tutoring appointments, checking session schedules, handling payments, and facilitating communications between tutors and students. Tutors can accept or reject tutoring requests, while tutors and students can manage their schedules and view upcoming sessions on the platform. TeachReach aims to address the challenges of post-secondary education by enabling students to select suitable tutors based on detailed profiles and offering tutors a flexible income opportunity.
